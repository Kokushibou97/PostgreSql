# PostgreSql

an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that implements the SQL language among other features. PostgreSQL follows the SQL standards to a large extent but also includes its own extensions and additional features beyond what the standard requires.

So, while PostgreSQL uses SQL as its primary interface for interacting with databases, the PostgreSQL codebase is distinct from the SQL language itself. The codebase of PostgreSQL is written in C and is responsible for implementing various features, including support for SQL queries, data types, indexing, transactions, and more.
